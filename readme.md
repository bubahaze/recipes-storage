**This is the project I made on Hyperskill by Jetbrains platform.\
Hyperskill provides extensive theory on Java programming followed by exercises.\
A completion of set exercises on particular topic let us begin next theory topic.\
At the end of learning section there is a stage of project implementing gained knowledge.\
Finalizing the project means the author created an application step by step by him/herself using his/her knowledge and skills.\
 A breve description:\
-A registered-only user (providing validated email and password) can create, read, update and delete recipes.\
-Updating and deleting is possible only for the author of the recipe.\
-Every registered user can browse recipes, search them by category or by name containing specified string.\
-User (passwords encrypted) & Recipe entities are saved into H2 database.\
-All with respect to REST best practices and application layers.**\
