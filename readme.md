This is the project I made on Hyperskill by Jetbrains platform. 
A breve description:
-A registered-only user (providing validated email and password) can create, read, update and delete recipes. 
-Updating and deleting is possible only for the author of the recipe.
-Every registered user can browse recipes, search them by category or by name containing specified string.
-User (passwords encrypted) & Recipe entities are saved into H2 database.
-All with respect to REST best practices and application layers.
